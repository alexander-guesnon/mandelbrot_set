/*
 z_n+1 = (z_n)^2 + c
 c and z are complex numbers
 z_n
 n = 0 || positive integer
 z_0 = 0

 c is in the Mandelbrot set

c is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of zn never becomes larger 
c = MB when c < |z_n|
ex
c = 1


n = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} if this set dosnt get bigger than 
f(n) = (n)^2 + 1

n = goes to infinity
high n is the more accurate the image is
